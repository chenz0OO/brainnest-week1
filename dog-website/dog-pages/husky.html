        Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily and specifically for work as sled dogs. It refers
        to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and overall hardiness.[1][2] Though dogs such as
        the AKC/CKC-registered Alaskan Malamute may not contain "Husky" in their official name, the term still encompasses dogs
        of their type.[citation needed] Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also known as Alaskan huskies)
        represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs.[3][4]

        Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as expedition and trek style tour businesses, and as a
        means of essential transportation in rural communities.[5] Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new
        pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.[6]
