        The Labrador Retriever or Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from
        fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador
        region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world.

        The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog, but is widely kept as a
        companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[1]

        In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[2] imported
        progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland
        fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[2]

        During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to
        develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to
        Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of
        Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.
