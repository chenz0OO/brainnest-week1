        The Pyrenean Mountain Dog (French: Chien de Montagne des Pyrénées) is a breed of livestock guardian dog from France,
        where it is commonly called the Patou. The breed comes from the French side of the Pyrenees Mountains that separate
        France and Spain. It is recognised as a separate breed from the closely related Pyrenean Mastiff, which is from the
        Spanish side of the mountains.

        The breed is widely used throughout France as a livestock guardian, particularly in the French Alps and Pyrenees,
        protecting flocks from predation by wolves and bears. The breed is known as the Great Pyrenees in the United States,
        where it is also used to protect flocks from various predators.
