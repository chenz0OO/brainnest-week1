        The Lab Pointer brings together two mild-mannered dog breeds; the Labrador Retriever and Pointer to produce an
        intelligent, energetic dog that is the perfect addition to the active family with kids and pets or even a first-time pet
        owner who is new to living with a pooch. He interacts well with other dogs and pets and his sweet nature and love of
        play make him a terrific running or jogging companion.

        The Lab Pointer is a hybrid of Labrador Retriever and Pointer.

        The Lab Pointer is a new breed that almost certainly originated in the 1980s when the popularity in designer dogs first
        surfaced. Breeders mixed purebred dogs in order to introduce desirable physical attributes and personality traits as
        well as to eradicate known health issues. Although he is a young breed, the Lab Pointerâ€™s lineage has some impressive
        history. Both parent breeds come from a working/sporting background; the Labrador retriever from 19th century
        Newfoundland where he was used by fishermen to haul nets, ropes and pull in fish. The Pointer is rumored to date back to
        the 16th century when he was brought to England from Spain and Portugal for his keen hunting prowess (pointing!)
